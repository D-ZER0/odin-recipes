        Unwind after a hard day of pillaging with a delicious glass of mead.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>filtered water (or distilled)</li>
        <li>2-3 pounds honey (local raw honey is best)</li>
        <li>2 g champagne yeast (⅕ – ½ of a 5g package)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Simmer ½ gallon of water until warm.</li>
        <li>Add honey: 2 pounds for a dry mead or 3 pounds for a sweet mead. Stir until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Simmer (don't boil) for about 30 minutes, skimming off any scum that forms. 
            Remove from heat and let cool to about 100°F and pour into 1 gallon carboy.</li>
        <li>Add any extra ingredients you may want. See below for ideas.</li>
        <li>When the temperature is below 90°F, add the yeast. One package will make 5 gallons of mead, so use 
            between ⅕ of a package and ½ a package. I typically make two gallons at a time and divide the package 
            between the two</li>
        <li>Cap the bottle and shake well. Add more water to fill the bottle, making sure to leave 3-4 
            inches of headroom at the top. Take the top off and add an airlock. These are available at your 
            local homebrew store or online here.</li>
        <li>Once the airlock is in place, set the bottle in a cool spot for about 6 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
