    </p>

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 cup walnuts</li>
        <li>1 small zucchini, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1–2 teaspoons kosher salt + black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>one 24-ounce jar of your favorite tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the mushrooms, walnuts, and zucchini in a food processor. 
            Pulse a few times until the mixture is very finely chopped. 
            Transfer to a bowl. Repeat this process with garlic, onion, and carrots.
        </li>
        <li>Heat butter or olive oil over medium high heat. 
            Add your chopped veggies along with the spices. 
            Sauté for 7-10 minutes until very soft and fragrant. 
            Add tomato sauce and salt; stir to combine. Taste and adjust! 
            Your seasoning amounts will depend on your brand of sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Mix mascarpone cheese with grated garlic and salt. 

        </li>
        <li>Start with spreading a layer of sauce in the bottom of a 9×13 pan. Then, layer in the following 
            order for each layer: a few noodles, 1 cup sauce, a few dollops of mascarpone, 1/2 cup Parmesan, 
            1/2 cup mozzarella, and repeat (I usually get 4 layers out of this amount). End with noodles, sauce, 
            cheese, and dollops of extra sauce on top to make it pretty.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 40-45 minutes. Remove foil and broil for 5 minutes to get the 
            cheese browned on top. Let stand for 10 minutes or so, then cut and serve!
        </li>
    </ol>
